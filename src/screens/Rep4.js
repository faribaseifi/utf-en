      					<h3>Introduction of the Supporter Foundation of the University of Tehran </h3>

      					<p>The supporter Foundation of the university was established on 20th May, 2014 in the presence of distinguished members held at the Chancellor’s office. One of the major aims of the Foundation is to benefit from financial, moral and religious attributes of the benefactors who in turn strive towards the reinforcement of the university’s infrastructure by encouraging national missions and purposes, and encouraging students to achieving higher academic purposes and goals.  Since the University of Tehran is the emblem of Higher Education of the country, such a Foundation would best flourish in the soils of University of Tehran</p>

<p>A warm talk with Mr. Mohammad Reza Beyad, the first benefactor of SFUT from overseas
  </p>

  <p>Mr. Mohammad Reza Beyad, the Iranian entrepreneur who lives in London first donated 5 million Tomans on August 2nd 2017 and then another 5 million on October 7th 2017 to the Cooperative Account of SFUT.  In this short talk he shares his intentions of helping an Iranian university from thousands of kilometres away

    </p>

<p className="text-danger">As an introduction, please tell us a bit about yourself: </p>

<p>
 I come from a Trading family. My father was from Yazd, who travelled to India in the 1930’s to set up a Tea Trading business. I was born and had my schooling in Calcutta and moved to the UK in 1978. Strong family values, a sense of national pride and a strong commitment to helping those less fortunate than us, was a cornerstone of the upbringing that we received from our parents.

I am an entrepreneur, with global business interests; a passionate philanthropist and fundraiser on the Board of several UK Charities, including the development Board of a major London Hospital. I am also
Chair of Governors at a top independent co-educational school in southwest London.

I have three grown up children, all highly skilled and qualified in their own professions. Infusing and instilling in them a strong sense of the same values that I grew up with, is now my wife’s (also from Yazd) and my own responsibility.  </p>


<p className="text-danger">How did you find out about SFUT?  </p>


<p>I was fortunate to be informed of this opportunity by my sister, Dr. Maryam Beyad, from the Faculty of Foreign Languages and Literature, University of Tehran
 </p>


 <p className="text-danger">Your help is going to make positive differences in the lives of Iranian University students. How do you feel about this?  </p>


<p>I feel deeply humbled and honoured that I am able to make a difference to the lives of others and especially those of students. Social justice can only be attained when we as humans feel a sense of duty and concern for each other’s wellbeing. But I don’t want the students to feel that they are receiving kindness or help from others; or that we are doing them a favour. On the contrary, they are doing us a favour by providing a means for us to be the facilitator for God’s work. Only He provides; we simply carry out his orders.

Not all of us has the wealth of Bill Gates to change the lives of millions. However, if each one of us can make a difference to the life of at least one person, then this world will be a much better place to live in. As Martin Luther King once said, “Every man must decide whether he will work in the light of creative altruism or the darkness of destructive selfishness. This is the judgment. Life’s most persistent and urgent question is: what are you doing for others”.We have a duty of care and responsibility to other humans, irrespective of caste, creed or colour.   </p>


<p className="text-danger">As for the last question, what is your message to the students reading this interview? </p>

<p>We all have our own personal “Book of Life” and in that, we record all that we have done in this long journey and what we have failed to do. When we sit down one day to go through this “Book”, we should feel satisfied and with a sense of pride at what we have done and said at what we have achieved. At what we have contributed, in words and deeds, and many have we helped cross the road, when they felt weak and vulnerable.

My message to the students is a simple one…………..study hard, work hard, be respectful towards others, obey your parents and when you have reached the dizzy heights of success Enshallah ( God Willing ), always remember the path that you took to reach there. Look out for each other. Do not discriminate

I take much of my inspiration in life from my parents. My father taught me to be honest and hardworking, and my mother taught me to continue dreaming and to aspire high. However, always to care for those less fortunate than us. And most importantly, I was taught that to climb the ladder of success, you don’t have to push others off that ladder. These lessons have been so valuable in my life that I want to share it amongst the students reading this message.</p>
