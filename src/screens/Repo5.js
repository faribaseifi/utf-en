      					<p>The festival was attended by benefactors of the University of Tehran, board members of SFUT and the University president, Dr. Nili Ahmad Abadi, as well as students who volunteered and those who received scholarships and also members of Nika Plan (future benefactors). At the beginning of the festival, Dr. Sadatinejad, the director of SFUT, welcomed the guests and delivered a lecture. He stated that holding the festival of benefactors of the University of Tehran is a huge step for the university to become more popular in the field of science and technology. He added: "SFUT was founded in 2014 and was registered in 2016 to use the material and spiritual abilities of the benefactors and to support the university's top talents." The Managing Director of SFUT spoke about the most important activities carried out by the foundation over the past five years: "Granting scholarship to top students whose average in two semesters is over 17, supporting student applicants introduced by deputy for student affairs, the formation of student volunteers to collect student donations and constructing and improving university buildings are among the activities carried out by the foundation so far." Dr. Sadatinejad further added: "Benefaction has been one of the most important characteristics of Iranians before and after Islam. Over the course of more than 85 years, what has happened in the University of Tehran could not have been possible without benefactors. This year we are holding the fifth festival of the benefactors of the university and we will unveil new honors." Sadatinejad also announced the scholarship of more than 3,000 university students at the University of Tehran and said that during the early days of the foundation, 500 students were funded by the foundation. This number has now increased to over 3,000 students. These students receive a scholarship of 200,000 tomans per month.” He also mentioned that supporting six research projects of young professors in 2018 is the most important program of SFUT for the next year, adding: "We hope this is a step towards supporting young professors and developing science and research in the country." Referring to the need for 800 million tomans of credit for the reconstruction of dormitories at the University of Tehran, Dr. Sadatinejad said: "In the first phase, which was targeted at 200 million tomans, 63 million tomans was paid during the last week and 137 million tomans will be provided today." In the next section, a program was held named “Manam Daneshgah Tehraniam” – [ I am a member of the University of Tehran as well ] which aimed to meet the needs of the university campus, and with the efforts of benefactors and supporters of the University of Tehran, all the requirements of the university, which were predicted in 4 phases with the estimated cost of 800 million Tomans, were financed.
Afterward, the benefactors and supporters of the University of Tehran were honored. These benefactors have donated through student scholarship and student applicants, devoting their time and expertise, and refurbishment and equipping of university buildings. Then, Dr. Nili Ahmad Abadi, the president of the University of Tehran, delivered a lecture. He noted the important position of the benefactors in higher education in the country and emphasized on entrepreneurship at the university. "When these main pillars and entrepreneurs enter the university, one of the goals of the university, which is increasing entrepreneurship, can be achieved sooner. Fortunately, today, the presence of the benefactors at the University of Tehran is clearly evident and today they have made more valuable efforts. "

       Referring to the importance of more participation of benefactors and the number of people at the university, the president of the University added: "It is a great pleasure for the University of Tehran to see the presence of the benefactors regularly. They can be seen in every corner of this university. Many dormitories, faculties and even the central library of this university have been created through the assistance of the benefactors." Dr. Nili added: "The University of Tehran has the country's largest capacity for charity. If in past, it was only charitable contributions to the development of universities, dormitories, classrooms, and educational equipment, there is a bigger space today that could be more effective. The donations of the people in this field will definitely lead to the development of the country." The president of the University of Tehran said that, currently, university students are also among the benefactors. He added: "The entrepreneurship and social responsibility are among the goals of the third program of the University of Tehran. We hope that SFUT, along with the activities that it does, will contribute to the empowerment of students as well." Dr. Nili pointed out that there are plans at the university that can be achieved through the benefactors’ assistance. "What is expected from a student at the University of Tehran is not just to find a job. The more important issue is that the graduates of this university create new jobs." Finally, Dr. Nili referred to the role of SFUT in empowering university students: "What SFUT is doing, which I call the scholarship award, is helping to empower the students at the University of Tehran because they are among the elites of the country and they can go along the right path, and we hope that we will be able to work on the projects during the meetings we have with the board of directors." in addition to celebrating the benefactors of the University of Tehran, the other important achievements of the festival of the Benefactors of the University of Tehran include financing the needs of the University of Tehran, the announcement of the participation of the benefactors and co-workers to equip and improve the buildings of some colleges and the publication of the "Booklet of Benefactors of the University of Tehran.”
